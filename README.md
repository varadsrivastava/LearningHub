# The Learning Hub
Many learners in today’s world, from students to adults, are sometimes left with unanswered questions and doubts in mind, because either they don’t have anyone to tell them and the internet doesn’t yield relevant results or they don’t just require an answer, they require a discussion. That’s when we were hit by the idea of creating a website which could be a onestop place for any learner around the world.
In this website, we have placed a forum section, where people can discuss their doubts and problems, and a question-answer section, where people can ask questions and answer.
After months of studying Website development and implementing it in the right way, we converted our idea into a dynamic website which will cater to the needs of knowledge in the
present world.

## Objectives
The objectives were:
1. To make a place where learners from any age or walk of life can discuss their problems and get their doubts cleared, interactively in real time.
2. To provide a place for direct question answers about a particular topic.
3. Make the website user friendly, and incorporate all the features to cater to the knowledge needs of the generation.
4. To provide a resources-page ,for those looking for notes or material related to their study.
